# Healthcare Providers-Related Code Sets Translations to OMOP CDM Standard Concepts

This directory contains translations of healthcare providers-related code sets to OMOP CDM standard concepts.  
Below is a brief description of each code set and the corresponding CSV files located in this directory.

## Code Sets

### 1. Specialties Codes
These codes represent the classification of the healthcare professionals' specialties.
Codes are taken from the [Publishing Centre](https://pub.e-tervis.ee/classifications) managed by Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre (TEHIK), see [here](http://pub.e-tervis.ee/classifications/Erialad).

The mappings in this CSV file were created using the OHDSI tool [Usagi](https://ohdsi.github.io/Usagi/).

- **File:** [specialties_mappings](specialties_mappings.csv)
- **Description:** This file contains a list of codes representing the healthcare professionals' specialties, along with their mappings to OMOP CDM standard concepts.


## The Structure of Mapping files
Each CSV file contains the following columns:

- **source_code:** The original code or concept from the respective code set. The source code being translated into a Standard Concept. 
- **source_concept_id:** A foreign key to the Source Concept (refers to OMOP CDM CONCEPT table) that is being translated into a Standard Concept. 
- **source_vocabulary_id:** A foreign key to the OMOP CDM VOCABULARY table defining the vocabulary of the source code that is being translated to a Standard Concept. 
- **source_code_type:** The type of the source code (e.g., specialties).
- **source_code_description:** A brief description of the source code.
- **target_concept_name:** The name of the target Concept to which the source code is being mapped. 
- **target_concept_code:** The target Concept code to which the source code is being mapped. 
- **target_concept_id:** The unique identifier of the target Concept to which the source code is being mapped. 
- **target_vocabulary_id:** The identifier of the vocabulary from which the target Concept originates.
- **target_domain:** The domain in OMOP CDM to which the target Concept belongs (e.g., Provider).
- **target_concept_class_id:** The class ID of the target Concept (e.g., Physician Specialty, Provider).
- **updated_date:** The date when the mapping was last updated.
- **valid_end_date:** The date until which the mapping is valid.
