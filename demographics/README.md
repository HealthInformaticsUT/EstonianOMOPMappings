# Demographics-Related Code Sets Translations to OMOP CDM Standard Concepts

This directory contains translations of various demographics-related code sets to OMOP CDM standard concepts.  
Below is a brief description of each code set and the corresponding CSV files located in this directory.

All mappings in these CSV files were created using the OHDSI tool [Usagi](https://ohdsi.github.io/Usagi/).

## Code Sets

### 1. Education Codes
These codes represent the highest education acquired.
Codes are taken from the [classifications portal](https://klassifikaatorid.stat.ee/) managed by Statistics Estonia, see [here](https://klassifikaatorid.stat.ee/item/stat.ee/1e38c151-38ae-4be3-ab46-a591c0096b99/5).
The classification of acquired highest education is based on the International Standard Classification of Education ISCED-A 2011 and it contains only the possible levels of education acquired in Estonia. 
The code contains the letter "A" plus a one- to two-digit number. 

- **File:** [education_mappings](education_mappings.csv)
- **Description:** This file contains a list of codes representing the highest education acquired, along with their mappings to OMOP CDM standard concepts.

### 2. Language Codes
These codes represent the classification of languages. 
Codes are taken from the [classifications portal](https://klassifikaatorid.stat.ee/) managed by Statistics Estonia, see [here](https://klassifikaatorid.stat.ee/item/stat.ee/e42103c7-6fc6-4c66-921f-c46fbcfef205/11).
Codes have been developed on the basis of the international standard Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages ISO 639-2. 
Each language has been assigned a three-digit letter code.

- **File:** [language_mappings](language_mappings.csv)
- **Description:** This file contains a list of codes representing the main spoken language, along with their mappings to OMOP CDM standard concepts.

### 3. Marital Status Codes
These codes represent the classification of the actual marital status.
Codes are taken from the [Publishing Centre](https://pub.e-tervis.ee/classifications) managed by Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre (TEHIK), see [here](https://pub.e-tervis.ee/classifications/Tegelik%20perekonnaseis).
The description of the codes is slightly modified.

- **File:** [marital_status_mappings](marital_status_mappings.csv)
- **Description:** This file contains local codes for actual marital status, along with their mappings to OMOP CDM standard concepts.


## The Structure of Mapping files
Each CSV file contains the following columns:

- **source_code:** The original code or concept from the respective code set. The source code being translated into a Standard Concept. 
- **source_concept_id:** A foreign key to the Source Concept (refers to OMOP CDM CONCEPT table) that is being translated into a Standard Concept. 
- **source_vocabulary_id:** A foreign key to the OMOP CDM VOCABULARY table defining the vocabulary of the source code that is being translated to a Standard Concept. 
- **source_code_type:** The type of the source code (e.g., education, language, marital_status).
- **source_code_description:** A brief description of the source code.
- **source_name_eng:** A brief description of the source code in English, only for Education and Language codes.

- **target_concept_name:** The name of the target Concept to which the source code is being mapped. 
- **target_concept_code:** The target Concept code to which the source code is being mapped. 
- **target_concept_id:** The unique identifier of the target Concept to which the source code is being mapped. 
- **target_vocabulary_id:** The identifier of the vocabulary from which the target Concept originates.
- **target_domain:** The domain in OMOP CDM to which the target Concept belongs (e.g., Observation).
- **target_concept_class_id:** The class ID of the target Concept (e.g., Clinical Finding).

- **updated_date:** The date when the mapping was last updated.
- **valid_end_date:** The date until which the mapping is valid.

## How to Use
