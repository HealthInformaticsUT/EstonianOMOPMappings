# Main Code Sets Used in the Estonian Healthcare System Translated to OMOP CDM Standard Concepts

This repository contains translations of various health-related code sets used in the Estonian healthcare system to [OMOP CDM](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/index.html) (Common Data Model) standard concepts. 
The translations aim to facilitate the integration and standardization of health data for research and analytics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each containing CSV files with mappings for specific types of code sets. 
Below is a brief description of each subdirectory and its contents.

Each subdirectory contains a README file describing the structure of the CSV files within it and a brief overview of each code set.

- **Cancer Staging Codes, TNM Category Codes, etc.** 
- **Pathology-Related Codes** 
- **Symptoms and Side-Effects-Related Concepts**


### [Drugs](drugs)

This directory contains mappings for drug-related code sets. 
The mappings included are:

- **ATC Codes**
- **Local Drug Package Codes**
- **Local Drug Administration Route Codes**

## Translation Sources

Some of the translations in this repository have been sourced from the OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) vocabulary repository, [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/start). 
Athena is a comprehensive source of standardized vocabularies used in the OMOP CDM.

Additionally, some mappings were created using the OHDSI tool [Usagi](https://ohdsi.github.io/Usagi/). 
Usagi is a semi-automated mapping tool that uses natural language processing to suggest possible mappings between source codes and standard concepts in OMOP CDM. 
Users can review and validate these suggestions to ensure accurate mappings.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the appropriate subdirectory to access the CSV files.
3. Use the files to map your local data to the OMOP CDM standard concepts.
